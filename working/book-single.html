            <p class="flex-item-feature-txt element">A #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!<br><br>

                Featured in its own episode in the Netflix original show Bookmarks: Celebrating Black Voices!<br><br>
                
                National Book Award winner Jacqueline Woodson and two-time Pura Belpré Illustrator Award winner Rafael López have teamed up to create a poignant, yet heartening book about finding courage to connect, even when you feel scared and alone.<br><br>
                
                There will be times when you walk into a room
                and no one there is quite like you.<br><br>
                
                There are many reasons to feel different. Maybe it''s how you look or talk, or where you''re from; maybe it''s what you eat, or something just as random. It''s not easy to take those first steps into a place where nobody really knows you yet, but somehow you do it.<br><br>
                
                Jacqueline Woodson''s lyrical text and Rafael López''s dazzling art reminds us that we all feel like outsiders sometimes-and how brave it is that we go forth anyway. And that sometimes, when we reach out and begin to share our stories, others will be happy to meet us halfway.<br><br>
